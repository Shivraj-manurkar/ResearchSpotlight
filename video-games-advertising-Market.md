As of 2023, the market was valued at approximately <strong>$10 billion</strong>. With a surge in mobile gaming, the expanding audience, and the shift towards digital marketing strategies, analysts predict a robust compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of <strong>15%</strong> from 2024 to 2032.</p> <p>Forecasts indicate that by 2024, the market will reach <strong>$11.5 billion</strong>, and it is projected to escalate to <strong>$23 billion</strong> by 2032. This growth trajectory can be attributed to advancements in technology, such as augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR), which create immersive advertising experiences. Additionally, the rise of influencer marketing and partnerships with popular gaming platforms are enhancing ad visibility and engagement rates.</p> <p><strong></strong></p> <p>Another driver for market expansion is the demographic shift in gaming audiences. More than <strong>60%</strong> of gamers are now adults, representing a diverse demographic that advertisers are eager to engage. Incorporating in-game advertisements allows brands to reach target audiences more effectively than traditional media can offer. Moreover, the rise of eSports and live streaming platforms is creating new avenues for advertising that were previously untapped.
