By 2032, this market is anticipated to reach around <strong>$50 billion</strong>. This exponential growth is driven by factors such as the increasing reliance on data analytics, advancements in technology, and a growing awareness of the importance of risk management solutions.</p> <p style="margin-top: 20px;"></p> <p>Furthermore, the rise in connected devices and smart technologies, such as smart home systems, wearables, and telematics in vehicles, is escalating the demand for tailored insurance solutions.
