The adoption of IQF technology allows for the preservation of nutrients, texture, and flavor, making it an attractive option for consumers. In 2023, the global IQF food market was valued at approximately <span>$25 billion</span>, with a projected Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of <span>6.5%</span> from 2024 to 2032. This growth can be attributed to the surge in the foodservice industry, the expansion of retail frozen food sections, and the rising popularity of plant-based foods.</p><p>Moreover, the ongoing changes in consumer lifestyles, particularly post-pandemic, have led to a greater reliance on frozen food products as they offer convenience and longer shelf life. It is estimated that the market for IQF fruits and vegetables will dominate, representing around <span>40%</span> of the total IQF food market share by 2032.
